"""calibrator.py
From https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos/master/yolo/calibrator.py

The original code could be found in TensorRT-7.x sample code:
"samples/python/int8_caffe_mnist/calibrator.py".  I made the
modification so that the Calibrator could handle MS-COCO dataset
images instead of MNIST.
